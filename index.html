        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-container">
            <p class="about-text">
                My name is Michael Gu, and I am a 19 year old sophomore pursuing computer science at the University of Washington. I am interested in learning and developing cloud technology
                and diving deeper into the realm of ML and AI. As I continue my long journey in academia, I am always looking for ways to apply/combine course 
                content to self-taught knowledge. As computer science inevitably evolves, I am constantly trying to keep up with millions of new techlogical advances every day and see how I 
                can potentially contribute my own technology to this massive market in the future as an entrepreneur.
                <br><br>
                Navigating this field depends on how well one can integrate into their community. In retrospect, this also means that individuals need to be provided opportunities to find 
                like-minded individuals and pursue their dreams. At the University of Washington, I am a co-founder and current acting Co-Chair of DEV[0], a registered student organization 
                dedicated to supporting aspiring developers in their endeavors. We run workshops on app and web development, and we also aim to begin mini-series where we introduce students
                to new tools and frameworks each week. We also bring in panelists, industry professionals from the greater Seattle area, and have them talk about their work and give our
                members insight into future career paths and what real careers in computer science look like. DEV[0] has been an extremely gratifying experience for me, especially in seeing how we have supported many 
                in what can oftentimes be an intimidating field. 
                <br><br>
                Outside of academics, I run a small non-profit called Musicians for Humanity (MFH), which operates out of two high schools in Oregon. Through charitable events and concerts, MFH is 
                able to raise money for global humanitarian efforts as well as music education. We have been up and running for over three years now, and have raised hundreds if not thousands
                of dollars for relevant organizations and causes. I am a true believer in music education for all. I talk more about this more in a feature article written for UW's Allen School of Computer
                Science News, linked below.<br><br>
